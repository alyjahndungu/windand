## E-Commerce Microservice System Design

Designing a microservices architecture for an e-commerce platform, we need to consider scalability, fault tolerance, and modularity. Here is my logic for a high-level architecture that addresses the communication between microservices, data storage and more functionalities.

## User Management (User Microservice):

- Handles user registration, authentication, and authorization.
- It communicates with the client applications using RESTful APIs.
- User data can be stored in a user database, such as PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
- Authentication can be implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth 2.0.
- For additional features we can add social logins like Google, Github or Facebook

## Product Catalog (Product microservice):

- Will be managing product creation, retrieval, and updating product information.
- It exposes APIs to allow clients to search, filter, and retrieve product details.
- Product data can be stored in a separate product database, like Elasticsearch or a relational database.
- Adding a search engine to this catalog is a must

## Shopping Cart Management (Cart Microservice):

- Handles the management of shopping carts.
- It allows clients to add or remove items from the cart and calculates the total price.
- Cart data can be stored in a fast data store like Redis, which provides in-memory caching and supports atomic operations.

## Order Processing ( Order microservice):

- Manages the processing of orders.
- It handles order placement, integrates with payment gateways, and initiates order fulfillment.
- Order data can be stored in a separate order database, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.

## Communication between Microservices:

- Microservices can communicate with each other using synchronous or asynchronous protocols like HTTP/REST, gRPC, or message queues.
- Event-driven communication patterns can be used to propagate changes or updates across different microservices.
- Message brokers like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ can be utilized for asynchronous communication.

## Data Storage:

- Each microservice can have its dedicated database to ensure loose coupling.
- A combination of relational and NoSQL databases can be used based on the specific requirements of each microservice.
- Caching mechanisms like Redis or Memcached can improve performance and reduce load on databases.

## Additional Components:

- API Gateway: This is the main single entry point for client applications, handles authentication, and routes requests to the appropriate microservices eg Product microservice, user microservice etc..

- Event Streaming: Streaming platforms like Apache Kafka can be used for capturing and processing real-time events, enabling event-driven architectures.

- Monitoring and Logging: Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack can be employed for monitoring and logging purposes to ensure system health and detect issues.
